# MediRecord
BASEF 2022 MediReord project

The blockchain_3.py file (located in the "MediRecord" subfolder) is the main blockchain program. The HTML file contains the HTML webpages that iterface with the python through HTTP socket programming. Run the blockchain_3.py file using python3 on the terminal and specify the port to run MediRecord on using '--port <port number>'. After running the program, you should be able to access the MediRecord chain by opening the HTML home page (located in the "MediRecord" subfile) on a chrome browser.
  
The "Experimental_File" subfolder contains miscellaneous python and HTML files created during the development of the proof-of-concept. These were included to show the process and development behind the proof-of-concept.
